# Amazon-Smart-locks
In this project, I conducted a detailed market analysis of smart locks available on Amazon to aid a smart lock manufacturing company in formulating a competitive entry strategy. I began by employing web scraping techniques to gather comprehensive data on various smart locks, including product specifications, pricing, customer reviews, and ratings. The collected data was then meticulously cleaned and manipulated to ensure accuracy and consistency. I performed an in-depth analysis to uncover key market trends, popular features, and consumer preferences, while also evaluating competitors to identify market gaps and opportunities. Using Excel, I created insightful visualizations and reports that highlighted critical findings and offered actionable recommendations for product development and marketing strategies. This analysis provided valuable insights that helped the company position its smart lock product effectively in the market.
